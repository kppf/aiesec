Our membership base consists of more than 86.000 young people in over 2.400 universities in 113 countries and territories. Local, National and International offices are managed by students or recent graduates. AIESEC is run by youth, for youth. 
<br /><br /> 
Together, the network manages relationships with well over 8.000 partners, facilitates more than 5.000 International internships, 15.000 International Volunteer Experiences, 24.000 leadership experiences, and organizes over 500 conferences each year.</p>
